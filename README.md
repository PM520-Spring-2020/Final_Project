Final Project

This is a place for you to upload your final project. Instructions are as follows:

* Choose one of the following topics. 
* Address the problem using statistical computing. 
* Write up your work using Rmarkdown. 
* Upload your report to your copy of this repository (preferably as a .md or .pdf).

Due date: Monday May 11th @4pm.
Note that this is a ‘hard' deadline.

Possible topics (see slides for lecture 12 for more details):

* The Sudoku exercise.
* Implement tempered MCMC to simulate Gamma rvs. Do both Gamma(2.3,2.7) and Gamma(0.1,0.01). You must use a perturbation kernel. So something like q' = q + Normal(0,sigma^2). 
* Use simulation to tackle one of the “Riddler” problems on the slides.
* Report on a question from your own research that uses statistical computation.
